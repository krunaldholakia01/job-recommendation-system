Today, this includes making sure artificial intelligence (AI) and data driven technology are more trustworthy.\n\nOver the next few years, the majority of our internet health programs will be on ensuring more trustworthy AI. For us, this means two things: human agency is a core part of how AI is built and integrated and corporate accountability is real and implemented. As part of this effort, we are exploring projects that invite the public to participate in creating trustworthy AI by willingly creating and donating data.\n\nMost significantly, this includes the Common Voice project, which aims to shape the future of voice AI! Voice AI leaves most languages, accents and demographics behind. This project seeks to build openly available data sets for training machine-learning driven voice technologies.

102,Chief of Staff to the Cofounder/CTO,Monzo Bank,"Leeds, England, United Kingdom",Director,Full-time,Administrative,"Information Technology and Services, Computer Software, and Financial Services",,No longer accepting applications,"['👋 Hi there, I’m Jonas, cofounder and CTO at Monzo.\n\nI’m looking for a right hand person to help me scale myself, my team and help me run my organisation. You should have a technical background, be a good communicator, good at running teams and interested in tech startups. Beyond that I am flexible 😀I am happy to chat to consider people at different stages in their career and can imagine it being a good fit for a wide range of career paths such as engineering, engineering management, product management or data science.\n\nI think of this as a rare chance to be part of the leadership team that takes a growth stage, pre-IPO tech company to the next level. This could come in handy if you\'re looking to start a tech startup one day. Or if you have done so in the past and want to see what the growth stage is like before trying again. Whatever it is that you\'re looking to do after Monzo, I\'ll be happy to help you onwards on that path.\n\nOn a given day, you might\ntalk to people in the organisation to see where we can do more to help them\nfacilitate organisation-wide goal-setting, planning and decision making processes\nhelp me hire key roles in the organisation\ndraft strategies, responses to regulators, board updates, announcements, etc\nrepresent me in meetings when there are scheduling conflicts\nmediate (or pre-empt!) misunderstandings between people in and outside of Monzo\nmanage the budget and financial plan for my organisation\nbrief me before meetings with board, investors or regulators\nWith that in mind, I’m looking for somebody who\nis passionate about making money work for everyone What we have achieved over the last six years as a business was considered extremely unlikely when we set out. We obtained a banking license (even though we were mostly a bunch of programmers who never worked in banking), grew to 5m+ customers, have the highest growth and customer satisfaction in the UK market, built an organisation of 1500+ people and grew revenues to £100m+/year.\nIn order to achieve Monzo\'s mission of making money work for everyone, we will need to achieve equally unlikely things successfully for many more years. I\'m looking for somebody ambitious who is motivated by that challenge.\nhas a technical background It is important to me that you are deeply familiar with the work of building software and systems and can independently form an opinion of a technical approach and organisational structure. It\'s not a dealbreaker if you haven\'t developed software personally, but in that case please focus on how else you picked up this skill in your answer (e.g. maybe as a PM or data scientist working closely with engineers).\nYou should also be able to self-serve basic data analytics tasks using SQL. This way you will never be blocked on ""waiting for data"" from anyone, which will make it much easier to build an intuition about the business.\ncan run teams or projects efficiently This means running rituals such as planning, proactively updating stakeholders, prioritising the work we do in the CTO Office and more generally that we set good goals and then achieve them.\nI\'m not super structured, so a key part of your responsibilities will be to make sure nothing falls through the cracks and that I\'m always thinking about the most important things.\nhas a deep interest in what makes some companies more successful than others How come companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook have been orders of magnitude more successful than other companies - including legacy banks - over the last 20 years? What can we learn from them - both as a company and for our engineering organisation? What can we learn from the next generation of technology startups? From Airbnb or Stripe or Spotify? What can we do to do even better than even those companies?\nI\'m not expecting you to have the answers (because there are no clear answers!), but you should be deeply interested in these questions and have formed some independent opinions on them. More generally I\'m looking for somebody opinionated who will tell me when I\'m wrong.\nworks well with many different stakeholders In this role you will need to work with a huge range of different stakeholders. Folks in junior and senior roles at Monzo, folks with very different degrees of technical understanding, people with or without Monzo context. A big part of this is being able to clearly communicate ideas verbally and in writing at the right level of abstraction for your audience.\nOn a related note, everyone in my team is really lovely and I\'d like to keep it that way. Please don\'t apply if you see other people as resources to be used to further your own goals, rather than as humans to connect with, understand and support 🙏\n\nHopefully we can chat soon!\n\nJonas\n\nLogistics\n\nLocation:\n\nAnywhere in the UK, Ireland, France or Germany (as we have payroll in those countries) but you need to be able to spend at least a few days a month in our office in London. We can pay for relocation and sponsor a visa.\n\nCompensation\n\nDepending on experience £75k - £160k/year cash plus meaningful stock options\n\nProcess\n\nI’ll review all applications personally and the first call you’ll have is with me. If you don’t have an “up-to-date” CV, just write a few sentences about yourself and point me in the direction where I can learn more about you.\n\nFollowing that there will be a series of in-person/video interviews, as well as a written take-home task.\n\nDue to the amount of applications, I unfortunately won\'t be able to give feedback on the applications - as much as I\'d like to.\n\nEqual Opportunity Statement\n\nAt Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.\n\nWe\'re an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.']"
